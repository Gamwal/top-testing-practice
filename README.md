# Test Driven Development in JavaScript

This project provides a collection of utility functions and a test suite to verify their functionality, including functions for string manipulation, basic arithmetic operations, Caesar Cipher encoding, and array analysis.

## Features

- **capitalize(string)**: Capitalizes the first letter of a string.
- **reverseString(string)**: Reverses a given string.
- **calculator**: Object with methods to add, subtract, divide, and multiply numbers.
- **caesarCipher(string, num)**: Encodes a string using a Caesar Cipher with a given shift.
- **analyzeArray(array)**: Analyzes an array to return the average, minimum, maximum, and length.

## Testing

Tests for each function are included in `index.test.js`, and they can be run using a JavaScript testing framework like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

### Example

To run the tests, use:

```bash
jest index.test.js
```
